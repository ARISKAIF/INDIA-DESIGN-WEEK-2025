# Multi-Mode Hovercraft and Hybrid Mobility Vehicle

## Project Overview
This project presents the conceptual design of a **multi-mode mobility vehicle** capable of operating across **air, water surface, and near-water environments**. The design was developed using **Autodesk Fusion 360** as part of **India Design Week 2025**.

The primary objective of the project is to explore **modular propulsion integration** within a single structural platform, allowing the vehicle to adapt to different operational modes using interchangeable propulsion configurations.

## Design Objectives
- Develop a single vehicle platform capable of multi-environment operation  
- Integrate modular propulsion units for air and water use  
- Maintain structural balance and symmetry across modes  
- Ensure conceptual feasibility of weight distribution and stability

## System Description

### Structural Platform
The vehicle consists of a lightweight base platform designed to support:
- Operator seating and control interface  
- Structural truss members for load distribution  
- Propulsion mounting arms positioned symmetrically  

The structural layout prioritizes balance and modularity rather than optimized performance.

### Propulsion Configuration
The design supports multiple propulsion arrangements:
- **Aerial Mode:** Propeller-based lift units mounted on extended arms  
- **Hover/Surface Mode:** Air-assisted lift for surface travel  
- **Water Propulsion Mode:** Submerged propeller configuration for aquatic movement  

Propulsion elements are designed to be **interchangeable**, enabling mode-specific operation.
