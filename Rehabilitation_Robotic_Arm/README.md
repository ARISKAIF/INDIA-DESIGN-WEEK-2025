## System Description

### Robotic Arm Assembly
The robotic arm consists of a multi-joint configuration designed to:
- Support controlled motion suitable for rehabilitation exercises  
- Maintain compact geometry for indoor and clinical environments  
- Allow simplified kinematic motion paths  

The design focuses on **mechanical structure**, without control or actuation optimization.

### Linear Rail Mechanism
A linear rail is integrated at the base to:
- Extend the effective workspace of the robotic arm  
- Reduce the need for increased arm reach  
- Support smooth translational motion along a single axis

### Tool Changer and End-Effectors
The system incorporates a **detachable tool interface** allowing:
- Different rehabilitation tools to be mounted  
- Task-specific therapeutic interaction  
- Controlled use under supervised conditions  

Tools are designed exclusively for rehabilitation purposes.
